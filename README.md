HTML5 Validation
----------------

A simple app to showcase the power of HTML5 validation

The app consists of an simple index.html page containing an error form. All the fields in the form use various parts of HTML5 validation to show how a form can be validated without JS.


To run the page:
----------------

- open the app folder and double click on the index.html file.


To install app and dependancies.
--------------------------------

- You will need ruby, sass and npm (via NodeJS) installed on your system.
- Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the folder
- Run npm install to install all dependancies

- Once installed, in the command prompt type 'grunt sass' to perform a simple sass task to compile the sass into css and re-create the main.css file. Alternatively run 'grunt watch' to watch the sass files and compile when a change is made.

Dependancies include:
	- Bower
	- Grunt
	- grunt-contrib-sass
    - grunt-contrib-watch
